INTRODUCTION						*transbuffer-introduction* {{{

Two vim instances are running.

	---------       ---------
	| GVIM1 |       | GVIM2 |
	---------       ---------

and GVIM1 is editing "hello.txt".

The next two commands will move
hello.txt buffer to GVIM2. (and GVIM1 buffer is closed)
>
	" Execute this command on GVIM2.
	:TransGetBuffer GVIM1 hello.txt
<
or
>
	" Execute this command on GVIM1.
	" (you can omit "hello.txt" argument
	" if current buffer is "hello.txt")
	:TransPutBuffer GVIM2 hello.txt
<

You can complete arguments by pressing |'wildchar'|.
If you do not change |'wildchar'| in .vimrc,
<Tab> is the default key for |'wildchar'|.
>
	" If you press <Tab> here,
	" you can complete Vim instances currently running.
	:TransPutBuffer 

	" If you press <Tab> here,
	" you can complete buffers currently editing on GVIM1.
	" (please remember you can use <C-d> to list up all candidates)
	:TransPutBuffer GVIM1 
<

If you want to open a current buffer on a new Vim instance:
>
	:TransPutBuffer +NEWVIM
<
will run a new Vim instance whose |v:servername| is "NEWVIM".
